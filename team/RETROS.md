# Retro 04/20/20

- Led by: Preetham Kesineni
- Present: Connor McIntosh, Edward Thai, Tomas Vera, Tristan Hernandez, Trung Bui

## Action item

- a goal: Being capable enough using Next.js to start the MVP of the project. Getting baseline code started.
- a change: Researching deeper into Next.js and looking into external libraries that may help our goal/project.
- a measurement: Having an inital project commit done on github. Having a review session for our understanding of next.js knowledge.

## Retro Assessment

- The Retro process I chose to use for this meeting is the Stop/Start/Continue framework. This involves initially discussing with the team what we would like to stop doing for the project, what we want to start applying, and what is working and should continue.
- The Retro was quick and efficient. We were able to as a group figure out what we believe is a more appropriate approach to completing our project efficiently.
- Advice I would give to the next person leading the retro is possibly trying a different framework. While I found this one to be efficient and effective with the project being so early on our team didn't have too much to discuss as far as stoping and starting. We mostly had the most to discuss on what we should continue.

## Action item

- a goal (at the end of 2nd iteration): Having a working database (MongoDB) abd incorporate more diverse range of charts.
- a change: Start working in smaller group (2 or less), allow flexibility in choosing issues to work on.
- a measurement: Keep track of the PRs rate.

Note:

#### Continue:

- Working collaboratively, efficient with MVP, agreement + communication going swell, slack active, at least a person to review PRs
- Spltting up workload effectively

#### Stop:

- So far no negatives...
- Assigning workload equally
- mob programming

#### Start:

- Brainstorming ideas -> clarification on current ideas in icebox
- Split up a big issue to smaller ones (beneficial for individual work)
- More individual coding (group of 2 or less)
- If any question, ask team members for clarification
- Reviewing MongoDB and OAuth

## Brief description of how retro went

- The retro proccess that I used in this retros is the start/stop/continue template. This template serves to identify what we are currently doing that is beneficial, what we are doing that is not helping the team and what should our team start doing so that we can better the team as a whole.
- The retros today went super well, each of the team members all chimed in about how they think the group project is going so far with everyone agreed that we have done a great job thus far.
- For the person that is conducting the next retros, a piece of advice that I would give would be to help facilitate conversation between group members more by asking thought-provoking questions.

Note:

#### Continue:

- Just keeping up the good work, everything has been working well

#### Stop:

- Everything has been working well
  -Maybe getting the Kanban board more organized

#### Start:

- Working on final ideas for this iteration
- Start getting things out of the icebox and into production if possible
- Figure out how we'll do lab 9 and test our deployment instructions.

## Brief description of how retro went

- I used the start/stop/continue template. Everyone entered their thoughts on the chat and we went over them to complete this entry.
  -The retro today went well, each memeber got their ideas in on the chat, then we discussed them live. Overall we agreed we have been doing well on all workflow areas.
- It is a bit tough to keep conversation going so maybe for a next the leader should focus on having questions lined up to discuss.
- Overall we concluded that our workflow works well, we may need to change some things with our Kanban board and ways to organize our codebase.
