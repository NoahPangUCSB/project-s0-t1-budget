Which of the 10 powerful questions did you ask?
Number 7

Describe your sprint goal here.
For the next Demo we want to have the new graphs implemented as well as have oauth working. Focus on saving user's data.

Describe briefly how you came up with that goal.
These are two important goals and necessities for our app to work and provide value, as a result we decided to focus on implementing these as soon as possible.

## Discussion of previous Sprint Goal

Briefly: was the sprint goal acheived? Was it too ambitious? Too modest?

Our last goal was to have good data graphs, Finish MVP

We did finish the mvp and provided a good visual representation of a user's expenses, as a result we met our spring goal.

What obstacles remain to completing MVP:

- Implementing the graphs

Support that would be helpful from course staff to completing MVP

## Key obstacles to future iterations (beyond MVP):

- Storage of lifetime data beyond first time entry repeated month to month inputs
- Usage of any database framework to store the data of the application user.
- Exploration into different graphing models for visual output
